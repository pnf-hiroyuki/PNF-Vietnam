            <h2>ðŸ”¹ About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a <strong>licensed physical therapist</strong> with nearly <strong>20 years of clinical experience</strong>, specializing in <strong>neurological disorders, musculoskeletal conditions, sports injuries, and chronic diseases</strong> through <strong>Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF).</strong></p>

            <p>Currently based in <strong>Vietnam</strong>, I am committed to <strong>providing specialized PNF therapy and promoting its benefits</strong> to enhance rehabilitation quality nationwide. My mission is to <strong>contribute to the advancement of Vietnamâ€™s rehabilitation field</strong> by increasing access to expert treatment and training.</p>

            <p>Throughout my career, I have worked in <strong>acute, recovery, and long-term rehabilitation settings</strong>, as well as in <strong>home-based therapy and private practice</strong>. My expertise extends to <strong>sports rehabilitation</strong>, where I develop <strong>PNF-based training programs</strong> for athletes to optimize <strong>performance and injury prevention.</strong></p>

            <p>Beyond clinical practice, I actively participate in <strong>academic presentations, workshops, and conference organization</strong>, striving to further the adoption and innovation of rehabilitation techniques. I am dedicated to <strong>expanding the applications of PNF therapy</strong> and <strong>tailoring individualized rehabilitation plans for every patient.</strong></p>

            <p>Using <strong>world-class PNF techniques</strong>, I support <strong>functional recovery, daily movement improvement, and athletic performance enhancement.</strong> Through my work, I aim to <strong>establish an environment where more people in Vietnam can access high-quality rehabilitation services.</strong></p>
